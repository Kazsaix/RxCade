<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>This version of pong is a fully functional single player game where the first to score 7 points wins. The up and down arrow keys are used to control the player paddle. The player faces a computer which is limited in paddle movement and reaction time. The ball bounce angle is dependant on the relative position on the paddle where the strike occurs. Steeper angles are deflected the further from the centre of the paddle. Furthermore, paddle strike position dictates the speed increase of the ball, with more centred shots increasing speed. The player can pause the game the &lsquo;P&rsquo; key and restart the game with the &lsquo;R&rsquo; key once in the game over screen.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The pong game is built following the functional reactive program style, by utilising a Model-View-Controller architecture where the model is stored as a constant and the controller updates frames by creating a new model state from the old state. This is done using a state reducer function to scan through the game frame observable and perform calculations on the current game state to create the next frame. Every action performed on the game state is programmed in a pure manner, where a new state is returned after a calculation is performed, such as moving the positions of game entities or changing the velocity vector of the ball. The new game state can then be passed into the update view function to render the html elements in the view aspect of the architecture.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The game uses an interval observable set at 10ms to represent each frame that needs to be rendered as the model. Each frame is given a Tick game event class. The game event classes give the game logic insight into what the user is inputting into the game. Events such as key presses and game frame ticks allow the model of the game state to be maintained. The events are combined into an observable stream of game events. The game model is updated using a function called reduceState, which takes the current game state and performs the current game event class from the observable stream. Respective key presses have their effects applied to the game state, while tick events calculated the movement for the entities and check for collisions between both the ball and paddles and the ball and playing court boundaries. If collisions are detected, new ball velocities are created with their updated direction and speed. The game state reducer function returns a new game state object, such that the observable is transformed into a stream of game states for each frame. These game states can then be fed into view architecture to perform any impure manipulations to the browser environment to update the visuals.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>To create a functional programming game, side effects of the code must be avoided as much as possible, with the only effectful code relating to manipulating the view elements of the game. The entirety of the code is designed using immutable types. Care was taken to ensure that the code follows a functional style, with all code that leads to an impure side effect being the code that initialises the html elements, the update view function which updates the game entity positions, and the initial call to Math.random() to generate a seed for the random number sequence. &nbsp;The update view function is called at the subscription of the frame game state reducer observable, ensuring that the observable stream is pure throughout its lifecycle.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>An infinite random sequence is used to create a functional random number generator. Standard random number generators are considered impure as its value is not dependant on its input. However random numbers are required in a game to provide variation to the user, when serving the ball, to create different speeds and angles that the ball can exhibit. A seeded random lazy sequence is used in the code to reduce the impure effects of the code. Math.random is used to initialise the seed, and this seed is outputted to the console so the variation of the random sequence can be inspected and debugged if required. The sequence was used with an impurely generated seed to still provide the players with some randomness.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The breakout game is built on top of the existing codebase for pong, reusing many of the functions already created for ball and paddle physics. This implementation uses the mouse to make the paddle follow the mouse&rsquo;s current position. Currently just a ball juggling simulator as it is incomplete.</p>
